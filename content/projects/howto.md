HOW TO was our first univesity project. It was developed with the purpose of teaching through visual aid. It provides step wise instruction and one can drag and drop the elements to complete the task. The task that we implemented were HOW TO Assemble a copmuter(back cables only for begineers), HOW TO crimp a RJ-45 and similar.
